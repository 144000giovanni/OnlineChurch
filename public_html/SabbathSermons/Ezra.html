        <h1>Ezra the Priest</h1>

        <div>
            <p>This sermon is about Ezra the scribe. He lived in the time when Persia ruled the world.
            God allowed Israel to become slaves in Babylon because of their years of disobedience
            and apostasy. He promised that they would only be slaves for 70 years. After
            this, God would permit them to return to their land and provide a way
            to restore and rebuild the city of Jerusalem and the temple. This time of 
            rebuilding and restoration happened when the Persian kingdom overthrew the kingdom of Babylon
            to become the new greatest empire as predicted in the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar.
            A decree was given by the king of Persia to restore and rebuild the temple of Jerusalem
            and the city.  
            </p>
            <p>Here is the quote of the decree from Ezra 1:1-4:</p>
            <blockquote cite="Ezra 1:1-4"> 

                {1:1} Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and [put it] also in writing, saying,
            {1:2} Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which [is] in Judah. 

            {1:3} Who [is there] among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he [is] the God,) which [is] in Jerusalem. 

            {1:4} And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that [is] in Jerusalem.     
                
            </blockquote>
            <p>Verse 1 reveals that this decree was already prophesied by Jeremiah many years ago. We can see from this verse that God is in control.  He controls the affairs of nations.
                Kings are subject to God's authority.  King Cyrus was a not a believer of the true God of the Hebrews.  But God used him to accomplish His purpose for His people.
